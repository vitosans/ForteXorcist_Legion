# ForteXorcist_Legion
Forking ForteXorcist and updating it to work with Legion

This was the last message that was posted to WoW Interface: 

Things, that should work:
- Login without LUA errors
- Class files (all specs):
- Death Knight
- Demon Hunter
- Druid
- Hunter (might need some tweaks on talents, feedback is welcome)
- Mage
- Shaman
- Warrior
- Rogue
Things, that are still on my list:
- Class files:
- Monk
- Paladin
- Priest
- Warlock
- General:
- Find a way to fix multiple Unstable Afflictions
- Recode the Rune Cooldown System for Death Knights
- Find a way to fix the icon bug after reloading the UI
- Implement honor talents
